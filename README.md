# Unixode Package

This is a LaTeX package to typeset unicode in mathematics. A minimal example would be

```tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unixode}

\begin{document}
    The vorticity $ω$ is defined as $ω = ∇ × u$.
\end{document}
```

That example may then be compiled either with `pdflatex` or with `xelatex`.
